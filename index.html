  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>I'm a software developer currently working at <a href="http://ackroo.com">Ackroo</a>, building a gift card and loyalty platform.
    I love learning new technologies, and I occasionally <a href="blog">blog</a> about my experiences with them.</p>

  <p>Generally I gravitate toward web development, including JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby projects.
    Native app development is really interesting too, and the ubiquity of smartphones is enabling a computing revolution that touches the lives of so many people. 
    We can do things now that we could never do before, and I find that incredibly exciting.</p>

  <p>Feel free to give me a shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}">Twitter</a> or check out my <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">Github</a> account for a full list of projects.</p>

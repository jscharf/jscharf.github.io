I am a software developer with a love for technology. Generally I gravitate toward web development, including JavaScript, PHP, and C# projects. Mobile app development is really interesting too, and the ubiquity of smartphones has enabled an app revolution that touches the lives of so many people today. We can do things now that we never could before, and I find that incredibly exciting.

## Education

I am currently studying [Internet Application & Web Development][IAWD] at Algonquin College.

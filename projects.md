## Commercial

#### Fitness Tracker

Created in 2014

A fitness tracking app for a gym near Toronto, ON to replace their paper-based tracking system. The idea was to offload some of the work done by the trainers by having the athletes enter their own data. The athletes and trainers would then be able to track programs and workouts together.

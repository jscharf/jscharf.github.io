> When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.

> – John Lennon

I am opening with a quote from John Lennon because I think it speaks to the impact of education, but more importantly, it speaks to my belief that life is just one long journey in the pursuit of happiness.

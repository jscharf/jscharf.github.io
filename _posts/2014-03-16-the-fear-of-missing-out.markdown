What do you do if you are at a music festival and two of your favourite bands are playing in the same time slot on two different stages? Do you try to go to both, and miss out on parts of both shows? Or do you completely commit to one and completely miss the other? Either way, you miss out on something, and there’s nothing you can do.

The fear of missing out (or fomo as it is sometimes called) is when people worry about being absent from an event, or some social experience. People who have fomo can’t stand missing out on things. It breaks their heart every time they want to go to something and they can’t. Even in cases where they may not even have wanted to go to said event, but later they hear how fun it was, and they wish they had been there.

So what is this all about? Why do people have such a hard time missing events these days? Well personally, I think it has a to do with the social media revolution happening right now. People are sharing more and more experiences online, because various applications (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and technological advancements have made it incredibly easy to do so. The ubiquity of smartphones has caused the amount of media shared by everyday people to skyrocket in recent years. With all these pictures and videos being shared, it’s easy to come across one posted by one of your friends and think to yourself, I wish I had been there.

On top of this, people just generally seem to tell their friends they missed if they decide not to go to an event, or couldn’t be there for whatever reason. “Man you missed out on an epic night last night” is a pretty common phrase these days. I totally understand too, I have almost definitely said this to someone before. If one of my friends wasn’t at something I really wanted them to be at, why wouldn’t I tell them they missed out, wouldn’t that encourage them to be at future events?

I think the fear of missing out is not something someone gets overnight, but rather something that is developed over time. I feel like there is some social science behind the concept, but I’m just going by what I read and observe in everyday life. You can choose to agree or disagree with anything I have said here.

After all, this is just hogwash anyway.

I have been following the development of [Metor](https://www.meteor.com) for some time now. It's been pretty interesting to watch the steady stream of improvements come in - from adding Windows support to the big 1.0 release, and even adding official support for other JavaScript frameworks like Angular and React.

Meteor is a really interesting platform, and a seemingly ambitious one too. They want to be the defacto standard for JavaScript application development. Other languages have many different tools for developing and deploying applications, and it looks like Meteor is off to a really strong start in that regard.

I'm excited to see what the future holds for Meteor. New features are being added all the time, and once relational database support is added, a lot of the hold outs might finally give it whirl.

Check out [meteor.com/install](https://www.meteor.com/install) to get started.

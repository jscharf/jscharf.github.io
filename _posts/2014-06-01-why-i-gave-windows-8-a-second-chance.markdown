A while back I wrote a post about why I got rid of Windows 8. Well today I’m hear to tell you why I gave it a second chance, and that is because of an important update, Windows 8.1. Windows 8.1 addresses many of the concerns and annoyances I had with the original version of Windows 8. I’m guessing that I wasn’t alone with my concerns, and Microsoft listened to the backlash that it received for all the usability issues in the initial release of Windows 8. That’s good news for consumers, because it means that contrary to what we might think sometimes, Microsoft does care about us.

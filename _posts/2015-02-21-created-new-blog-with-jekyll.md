Today I copied the content from my old Wordpress blog to this blog, which was created using [Jekyll][jekyll], a static website generator. It's hosted for free using Github Pages, which is super cool! You can check out the [Jekyll repository][jekyll-gh] on Github or dive straight into [using Jekyll with Github Pages][using-jekyll-with-ghp].

My experience with it so far has been pretty great. It was reasonably straightforward to setup once I got all the dependencies installed, and creating a new page is as easy as creating a new text file with a naming convention. Provide a little front matter at the top and you can write away!

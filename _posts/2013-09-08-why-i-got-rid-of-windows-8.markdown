So... Windows 8.

One thing I really like is that when you copy or move multiple files as part of separate operations, instead of stacking a bunch of windows on top of each other, it will group them all together in one nice window and even provide a real-time graph of the read/write speed.

Another is the improved task manager. This is something I have been waiting for for a long time, and I’m pretty happy with the implementation. The new task manager now hides a lot of system stuff that you never looked at anyway, and puts the important stuff front and center.

However, the stark change between Windows 7 and 8 is where the OS really starts to bug me. I’m not saying that a new OS being really different from its predecessor is inherently a bad thing, but I think Windows 8 took a lot of the wins from Windows 7 and hid them behind a curtain.

The new Start screen is great, if you’re on a mobile device. If you’re on a desktop, like a lot of Windows users, it’s not the most intuitive way to use your computer. The button to shut down the machine took me about 5 minutes to find. That in itself in a huge problem. It makes sense from a mobile perspective because some people never turn off their phone or tablets. But there are certain functions that should be and were simple before, and now they’re not. I understand that software needs to evolve, but it must always be intuitive.

I also don’t understand why they make the start screen mandatory. Take OS X for example, which has a somewhat similar feature called launch pad, laying out all the applications installed on the computer in one convenient location. That’s a great feature, but it’s hidden away, only there when you need it. The Windows 8 start screen in contrast, is there every time you start your computer, whether you like it or not. I should mention that they may be fixing this issue with Windows 8.1, but still, why was it shipped that way in the first place?

Overall, it’s a good OS, but there just aren’t enough good things about it to outweigh all the annoying things about it. And that’s why I got rid of Windows 8.

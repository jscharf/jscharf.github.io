Today I would like to mention the silver lining.  For those of you who don’t know, the silver lining refers to the element of good that can be found in a bad situation.  Now I’m not about to say that there is a positive side to any bad situation, but there is something to be said about people who can pick out the good parts.  People who can accept an unfortunate circumstance but still see something good about it, won’t they be happier?  At the very least, they will be less sad than those who dwell on it. Learning from the past is important, but focusing on how to improve that situation going forward is key.
